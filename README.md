More interesting projects such as:
* [PSO and genetic algorithm comparision for finding global extrema](https://github.com/hevgan/university/tree/main/SI/PSO_vs_Genetic)
* [Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and LU-factorization methods for solving linear equations](https://github.com/hevgan/university/tree/main/MN/proj2) 
* [Lagrange's and Cubic Splines interpolations for elevation profile approximation](https://github.com/hevgan/university/tree/main/MN/proj3)

are soon to be relocated to their separate repositories.
